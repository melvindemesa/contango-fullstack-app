# Contango Fullstack App

This is a full-stack web application that enables users to upload their CVs and provide supplemental details such as their experience and skills. The application stores the uploaded files and submitted data securely, with a planned integration of AI services to analyze and validate the contents of the CVs in the future.

This project is structured to demonstrate modular fullstack development using Next.js (App Router), form data handling via API routes, PostgreSQL for storage, and Docker-based local development. It‚Äôs designed to be easily extended for AI-based screening, recruiter review tools, or applicant tracking workflows.

## üß† AI Integration (Planned)

While this application is designed to include AI-based parsing and validation of uploaded CVs or user profile data, **we have not yet integrated any external AI service** due to limited time and the absence of API credentials or compute resource provisioning.
